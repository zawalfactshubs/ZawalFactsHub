    "short": "Establish a consistent sleep schedule.",
    "long": "Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. Your body thrives on routine, which helps regulate your internal clock, improves sleep quality, boosts energy, and supports overall health. This also aligns your circadian rhythm and helps maintain hormonal balance."
  },
  {
    "short": "Create a calming bedtime routine.",
    "long": "Include activities like reading a book, listening to soft music, practicing deep breathing, or gentle stretching. Avoid screens for at least 30–60 minutes before bed to reduce blue light exposure, which can suppress melatonin production. A consistent routine signals to your body that it's time to relax."

  {
    "short": "Limit caffeine and stimulants in the evening.",
    "long": "Caffeine can stay in your system for up to 8 hours. Drinking coffee, tea, or energy drinks late in the day can make it difficult to fall asleep or reduce sleep quality. Replace evening caffeinated beverages with herbal teas or warm milk, which can promote relaxation and help your body wind down naturally."
  },
  {
    "short": "Avoid heavy meals close to bedtime.",
    "long": "Eating large or spicy meals right before bed can lead to discomfort, acid reflux, or indigestion, disrupting your sleep. Instead, opt for light snacks if needed, such as yogurt, bananas, or a handful of nuts. Give your body 2–3 hours to digest before lying down to improve sleep quality."
  },
  {
    "short": "Incorporate regular exercise into your day.",
    "long": "Physical activity during the day promotes deeper, more restorative sleep at night. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days, but avoid vigorous workouts right before bed, as this can raise your heart rate and make falling asleep harder. Morning or afternoon workouts are ideal for sleep regulation."
  },
  {
    "short": "Limit naps during the day.",
    "long": "Short naps (20–30 minutes) can boost energy, but long or late-afternoon naps can interfere with nighttime sleep. If you need to nap, aim for early afternoon and keep it brief to avoid disrupting your sleep-wake cycle. Regular naps should complement, not replace, proper night sleep."
  },
  {
    "short": "Get morning sunlight exposure.",
    "long": "Sunlight in the morning helps reset your circadian rhythm and signals your body that it’s time to wake up. Exposure to natural light for 20–30 minutes each morning can improve alertness during the day and help you feel sleepy at the right time in the evening, improving sleep quality."
  },
  {
    "short": "Manage stress before bed.",

  },
  {
    "short": "Reduce screen time in the evening.",
    "long": "Blue light from phones, tablets, and computers can suppress melatonin production, delaying sleep onset. Limit screen use 30–60 minutes before bedtime and consider using blue light filters or night mode if you must use devices. Reading a book or listening to calming music can be a better alternative."
  },
  {
    "short": "Keep your bedroom for sleep only.",
    "long": "Avoid using your bed for work, study, or watching TV. Associating your bedroom strictly with sleep helps strengthen the mental connection between your bed and rest. This practice, part of sleep hygiene, can make it easier to fall asleep quickly when you go to bed."
  },
  {
    "short": "Maintain a comfortable bedroom temperature.",
    "long": "The ideal sleeping environment is typically cool, around 18–20°C (65–68°F). A cooler room can help lower your core body temperature, which is necessary for initiating sleep. Use fans, air conditioning, or bedding layers to create a comfortable temperature for uninterrupted sleep."
  },
  {
    "short": "Avoid alcohol before bed.",
    "long": "While alcohol can make you feel drowsy initially, it disrupts sleep cycles and can reduce REM sleep, leading to poorer sleep quality. Limit alcohol consumption in the evening to avoid fragmented sleep and frequent awakenings during the night."
  },
  {
    "short": "Use relaxing scents.",
    "long": "Aromatherapy, such as lavender or chamomile essential oils, can have a calming effect on the nervous system. Diffusing these scents in your bedroom or using scented pillow sprays may improve sleep onset and help maintain deeper sleep."

  },
{
  "short": "Expose yourself to daylight during the day.",
  "long": "Spending time outdoors during daylight hours helps strengthen your circadian rhythm by clearly distinguishing day from night. Natural light boosts alertness, mood, and vitamin D levels, all of which contribute to better sleep at night. Even short walks outside can make a noticeable difference."
},
{
  "short": "Avoid bright lights late at night.",
  "long": "Bright indoor lighting at night can confuse your brain into thinking it’s still daytime. Dimming lights in the evening helps melatonin levels rise naturally. Use warm, low-intensity lighting after sunset to prepare your body for rest."
},
{
  "short": "Use night mode on devices if unavoidable.",
  "long": "If you must use screens at night, enable night mode or blue-light filters. These settings reduce blue light exposure, which interferes with melatonin production. While not perfect, they are better than full brightness and can reduce sleep disruption."
},
{
  "short": "Keep a consistent bedtime wind-down period.",
  "long": "A 30–60 minute wind-down period before bed helps your brain transition from alertness to relaxation. This routine should be predictable and calming, signaling to your body that sleep is approaching and reducing sleep onset time."

},
{
  "short": "Avoid working from your bed.",
  "long": "Using your bed for work or study weakens the mental association between bed and sleep. Keeping work activities outside the bedroom trains your brain to recognize the bed as a place for rest only."
},
{
  "short": "Wake up at the same time even after poor sleep.",
  "long": "Sleeping in after a bad night may feel helpful, but it often disrupts your circadian rhythm further. Waking up at your regular time helps reset your sleep cycle and improves sleep quality the following night."
},
{
  "short": "Reduce evening mental stimulation.",
  "long": "Activities that require intense thinking or problem-solving can keep your brain alert. In the evening, switch to low-effort activities to allow your mind to gradually slow down and prepare for sleep."
},
{
  "short": "Use consistent sleep and wake cues.",
  "long": "Repeating the same pre-bed and wake-up cues daily trains your brain to recognize when it’s time to sleep and wake. These cues may include specific sounds, lighting changes, or routines that reinforce consistency."
},
{
  "short": "Avoid lying awake in bed too long.",
  "long": "If you can’t fall asleep after about 20 minutes, get out of bed and do a quiet, relaxing activity. This prevents your brain from associating the bed with frustration or wakefulness."

}
,
{
  "short": "Separate worries from bedtime.",

},
{
  "short": "Use consistent bedtime signals.",
  "long": "Repeating the same signals each night—such as dimming lights or playing soft music—conditions your brain to recognize sleep time. Over time, these signals reduce the time it takes to fall asleep."
},
{
  "short": "Avoid emotionally intense entertainment at night.",
  "long": "Thrilling movies, arguments, or dramatic content can spike adrenaline and delay sleep. Choosing calming or neutral entertainment helps your nervous system stay relaxed before bed."

  "short": "Avoid planning tomorrow in bed.",
  "long": "Mental planning activates focus and alertness. If planning thoughts arise, gently redirect attention to breathing or relaxation instead of engaging with them."
},
{
  "short": "Expose yourself to fresh air daily.",
  "long": "Fresh air and outdoor exposure improve oxygen levels, mood, and circadian rhythm regulation. Even brief daily exposure can contribute to better nighttime sleep."
